### This repository contains the programs I wrote to solve challenges on www.codewars.com These pieces of code are from the beginnig of my programming journey.
### They are created during a period of overall one year, thus the code quality does vary a lot, but they solve the related problem.

### Furthermore, I will also upload some pieces of code I wrote beside of that like sort algorythms or linked list etc.
